The purpose of this "site" is to work as a technical companion to my website. For example, Obsidian Publish sites haveÂ [rss feeds at /rss.xml](https://help.obsidian.md/publish/seo), but they are quite basic, and there's no way to select a specific group of notes to be part of that feed. So I'm experimenting with the idea of manually [building an RSS feed](https://vladcampos.github.io/site/blog.rss).

For now, I won't set up a domain for this site, but if I do it in the future, it will be a subdomain of my main site.
