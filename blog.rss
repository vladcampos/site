      <title>I seriously need to use the bathroomâ€¦</title>
      <description>I am aware that I should not have done so, but I pressed the upper-left button on my Garmin to illuminate its display. Every time this happens, there are two possible outcomes. When I see that it is about 2 or 3 in the morning, it's so difficult to fall asleep again. Yes, I know, that's why we should never check the time. Anyway, when it is past 5 a.m., I magically sleep seconds after checking the time or coming back from the bathroom. Our brains are so weirdly wired.</description>
