        <description>2025-06-19 â€¢ After hacking my own #RSS feed for my #Obsidian Publish site, it is now time to try some ideas. The first one is automating my blog posts via #Mastofeed. I just created a rule that will compose a Mastodon post using the Title, Summary,Â Link, and Image from my RSS feed.

This first post/test has two goals. Make sure the automation is working and understand what will happen if one of the items, in this case an image, is not present in the original feed.</description>

        <description>If you&apos;re an Obsidian Publish user, you&apos;ve probably stumbled upon its default RSS feed by adding /rss.xml to your domain. And if you&apos;re like me, you quickly realized how incredibly limited it is â€“ so limited, in fact, that it&apos;s practically unusable for serious blogging. </description>
