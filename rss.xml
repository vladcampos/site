        <description>I&apos;ve been testing Slax Note and wanted to share my thoughts with you. In addition to voice-to-text, it refines your notes and offers both built-in and custom actions. I also appreciate being able to add words for better transcriptions, and, the option to type notes is really useful, especially useful for when I&apos;m in public.</description>

        <description>It&apos;s tempting to outsource more and more tasks to powerful AI tools. But how far should we go? Have we already reached a point where we&apos;re blindly handing over too much control? And what harm is this already doing to our growth and critical thinking?</description>

        <description>If you are an RSS lover like me, I think you should check feedle. Imagine having an RSS feed to follow a topic with posts from multiple creators. And what about narrowing that down even further to track posts about that specific topic but from a single creator? In today&apos;s video, I&apos;m showing how to do both.</description>

        <description>As Iâ€™ve said many other times, I believe there are some technologies that reached a stage of maturity where they could just be used indefinitely. What many people seem not to know is that itâ€™s possible to go back to enjoying that sweet spot.</description>

        <description>Following the pre-wetting of the filter with hot water, I add the coffee and pour water over it. What you see in the picture is a top-down view of an AeroPress at that stage. Now it&apos;s time to add the plunger, wait a few seconds, and, finally, press. I love to cook, by the way, but I really do follow recipes to the letter. Time and quantity are frequently eyeballed.</description>

        <description>Even if you donâ€™t know what RSS is, chances are you have it on your blog. What you may not know is how it can help you set up a newsletter and automatically share your blog posts on social media, among other things. Is it worth it? Well, I tried some ideas, and I have a few thoughts to share with you.</description>

        <description>I started typing &quot;what time...&quot; on Google to find out when a store I want to go to opens, and &quot;what time is it&quot; wasÂ the first search suggestion in the list. Seriously? It is highly probable that people would be typing that into a computer or phone. The time is already there, right in front of them! ðŸ˜³ Sometimes, modern life scares me.</description>

        <title>ðŸ“ƒ Refining my note-taking workflowâ€”lessons from Evernote for Obsidian</title>

        <guid isPermaLink="true">https://vladcampos.com/2025-06-24-refining-my-note-taking-workflow-lessons-from-evernote-for-obsidian</guid>
        <description>As someone who believes that serious note-taking needs a solid system, Iâ€™ve frequently encountered a challenge: effectively managing my ever-growing collection of notes. Dynamically switching between multiple views of the same information is a strategy I used a lot in the past. However, I lost that when I moved to Obsidian, as I find its handling of lists of notes less intuitive than Evernoteâ€™s elegant approach.</description>

        <description>That penholder on the Nomad case is very convenient, but when I wanted to bring the Supernote in my EDC pouch, it was always a pain to make it fit. I had to put some pressure on it to fold the holder down while zipping the bag.</description>

        <description>Where is my site? Even a direct search for my name brought back Medium&apos;s logo at the top of the list. Why is Medium now my main digital footprint? Why did my digital home suddenly vanish from Google&apos;s search results?</description>

        <description>2025-06-19 â€¢ After hacking my own #RSS feed for my #Obsidian Publish site, it is now time to try some ideas. The first one is automating my blog posts via #Mastofeed. I just created a rule that will compose a Mastodon post using the Title, Summary,Â Link, and Image from my RSS feed.

This first post/test has two goals. Make sure the automation is working and understand what will happen if one of the items, in this case an image, is not present in the original feed.</description>

        <description>If you&apos;re an Obsidian Publish user, you&apos;ve probably stumbled upon its default RSS feed by adding /rss.xml to your domain. And if you&apos;re like me, you quickly realized how incredibly limited it is â€“ so limited, in fact, that it&apos;s practically unusable for serious blogging. </description>
