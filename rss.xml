        <title>ðŸ“ƒ Refining my note-taking workflowâ€”lessons from Evernote for Obsidian</title>

        <description>As someone who believes that serious note-taking needs a solid system, Iâ€™ve frequently encountered a challenge: effectively managing my ever-growing collection of notes. Dynamically switching between multiple views of the same information is a strategy I used a lot in the past. However, I lost that when I moved to Obsidian, as I find its handling of lists of notes less intuitive than Evernoteâ€™s elegant approach.</description>

        <title>ðŸ“ƒ Another reason why I love how hackable the Supernote is. It now precisely fits my EDC setup.</title>

        <description>That penholder on the Nomad case is very convenient, but when I wanted to bring the Supernote in my EDC pouch, it was always a pain to make it fit. I had to put some pressure on it to fold the holder down while zipping the bag.</description>

        <description>Where is my site? Even a direct search for my name brought back Medium&apos;s logo at the top of the list. Why is Medium now my main digital footprint? Why did my digital home suddenly vanish from Google&apos;s search results?</description>

        <description>2025-06-19 â€¢ After hacking my own #RSS feed for my #Obsidian Publish site, it is now time to try some ideas. The first one is automating my blog posts via #Mastofeed. I just created a rule that will compose a Mastodon post using the Title, Summary,Â Link, and Image from my RSS feed.

This first post/test has two goals. Make sure the automation is working and understand what will happen if one of the items, in this case an image, is not present in the original feed.</description>

        <description>If you&apos;re an Obsidian Publish user, you&apos;ve probably stumbled upon its default RSS feed by adding /rss.xml to your domain. And if you&apos;re like me, you quickly realized how incredibly limited it is â€“ so limited, in fact, that it&apos;s practically unusable for serious blogging. </description>
