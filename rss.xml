        <description>It&apos;s incredible how solutions can have a side effect, creating new obstacles. And I secretly love dealing with that challenge.</description>

        <guid isPermaLink="true">https://vladcampos.com/2025-07-10-the-single-template-challenge-update</guid>
        <description>I managed to go from 3 Obsidian templates down to 2 using a very basic hack. And honestly, I think I could even get to just one with a little more courage! I also added a new &quot;time&quot; property to my templates, getting things ready for how I plan to use the upcoming Bases plugin.</description>

        <guid isPermaLink="true">https://vladcampos.com/2025-07-09-returning-to-a-beloved-book-universe</guid>
        <description>The last time I was so deeply involved with a universe, a book universe, was when I was reading my favorite author to this day, Fernando Sabino. He would repeat sentences, ideas, and situations across all these completely unrelated stories and books, so I always thought he was talking about his life, but with a little touch of fiction. One could say that in a way, there was a universe, the author&apos;s life universe, this parallel reality with so many recognizable things that we could understand and relate to.</description>

        <description>I&apos;ve been thinking a lot about how tempting it is to outsource more and more tasks to these powerful AI tools. Where should we draw the line to preserve our critical thinking, insights, and so many other human qualities that are still far superior to what AI could accomplish for us?</description>

        <description>When I asked Gemini Flash if it could do a specific task or if I should use Gemini Pro for that, it told me that there was no need to use Pro for that. Then, it came up with a detailed explanation of why it was perfectly capable of doing that and what kind of tasks I should ask Pro to do. It was hilarious. üòÜ I could only picture a worker telling me something like, ‚ÄúThere&apos;s no need to call my boss. I know how to do that.‚Äù</description>

        <description>Yesterday, I spent some time adjusting the settings of two Obsidian plugins‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäVoicenotes and BookFusion. That inevitably got me thinking about how cool it is to have apps and services automatically send information to a centralized space. What‚Äôs even cooler is that even if Obsidian ceases to exist tomorrow, all the files will still be organized and available in my computer‚Äôs file system.</description>

        <description>When you drag an image to an Obsidian note, it must be stored in a folder. By default, it goes to the main folder of your Vault, but you can change that.</description>

        <description>I&apos;ve been testing Slax Note and wanted to share my thoughts with you. In addition to voice-to-text, it refines your notes and offers both built-in and custom actions. I also appreciate being able to add words for better transcriptions, and, the option to type notes is really useful, especially useful for when I&apos;m in public.</description>

        <description>It&apos;s tempting to outsource more and more tasks to powerful AI tools. But how far should we go? Have we already reached a point where we&apos;re blindly handing over too much control? And what harm is this already doing to our growth and critical thinking?</description>

        <description>If you are an RSS lover like me, I think you should check feedle. Imagine having an RSS feed to follow a topic with posts from multiple creators.

        <description>As I‚Äôve said many other times, I believe there are some technologies that reached a stage of maturity where they could just be used indefinitely. What many people seem not to know is that it‚Äôs possible to go back to enjoying that sweet spot.</description>

        <description>Following the pre-wetting of the filter with hot water, I add the coffee and pour water over it. What you see in the picture is a top-down view of an AeroPress at that stage. Now it&apos;s time to add the plunger, wait a few seconds, and, finally, press. I love to cook, by the way, but I really do follow recipes to the letter. Time and quantity are frequently eyeballed.</description>

        <description>As someone who believes that serious note-taking needs a solid system, I‚Äôve frequently encountered a challenge: effectively managing my ever-growing collection of notes. Dynamically switching between multiple views of the same information is a strategy I used a lot in the past. However, I lost that when I moved to Obsidian, as I find its handling of lists of notes less intuitive than Evernote‚Äôs elegant approach.</description>

        <description>That penholder on the Nomad case is very convenient, but when I wanted to bring the Supernote in my EDC pouch, it was always a pain to make it fit. I had to put some pressure on it to fold the holder down while zipping the bag.</description>

        <description>2025-06-19 ‚Ä¢ After hacking my own #RSS feed for my #Obsidian Publish site, it is now time to try some ideas. The first one is automating my blog posts via #Mastofeed. I just created a rule that will compose a Mastodon post using the Title, Summary,¬†Link, and Image from my RSS feed.

This first post/test has two goals. Make sure the automation is working and understand what will happen if one of the items, in this case an image, is not present in the original feed.</description>

        <description>If you&apos;re an Obsidian Publish user, you&apos;ve probably stumbled upon its default RSS feed by adding /rss.xml to your domain. And if you&apos;re like me, you quickly realized how incredibly limited it is ‚Äì so limited, in fact, that it&apos;s practically unusable for serious blogging. </description>
